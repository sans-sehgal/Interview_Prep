## Dynamic Programming â€“ Important notes and Questions

1) Always return a value, write recursive code that returns a value to the functions, that can then be reutilized to to solve repeating subproblems. <br>

2) Always follow the technique of recursion -> memoization -> tabulation. <br>

3) For tabulation, just copy the memoized code with all the constraints. <br>
